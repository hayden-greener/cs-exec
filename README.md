# **Counter-Strike Configuration Files**

This repository contains my personal Counter-Strike autoexec and other configuration files.

## **File Location**

Place these files in your Counter-Strike config folder:
`...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\`

## **Usage**

To use the autoexec, open the console in-game and type:
```
exec autoexec.cfg
```

Feel free to explore and use these configs as you see fit.
